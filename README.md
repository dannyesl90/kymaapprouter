**Using Approuter and Python app in Kyma for user authentication**

I used this as a first project to check on how we can secure published apps in Kyma with user authentication by using an SAP BTP IDP.

**Landscape**
- SAP BTP (Trial)
- SAP Kyma environment
- SAP Authorization and Trust Management Service (Kyma generated)
- Docker
- Python 3.12 as the app (Dockerized)
- SAP Approuter image on Dockerhub (sapse/approuter:16.0.1)
